Final Tomatoes: ToDo’s and Issues

Meg first priority:
Views for Add Review Page, Add New Movie, Login and Register
start on controller if time—all js stuffs here (database in model, view html stuff)
look over html_special chars in w3C
getting images




see about writing junit test to check
check if overview parsing is going to have troubles with commas`

preset database info functions, possibly for our catch block in model constructor

getPicture and getName



MEG’S NOTES
AddMoviePage.php
	haven’t set require_once at top
	put in addMovie.php as action for form, doesn’t exist yet, could change
	probably want to put in character limits somehow, at least mention
	do we want to use type=date for year, not supported on IE
	radio buttons for rating instead of text field?
	ask for commas in cast, director(s), producers, directors, links
	no required vs. unrequired fields yet
	runtime in minutes currently
	box office in millions or not? currently not
